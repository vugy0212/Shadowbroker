**ShadowBroker** is a real-time, multi-domain OSINT dashboard that fuses 60+ live intelligence feeds into a single dark-ops map interface. Aircraft, ships, satellites, conflict zones, CCTV networks, GPS jamming, internet-connected devices, police scanners, mesh radio nodes, and breaking geopolitical events — all updating in real time on one screen.

Built with **Next.js**, **MapLibre GL**, **FastAPI**, and **Python**. 35+ toggleable data layers. TMany visual modes (DEFAULT / SATELLITE / NIGHTLIGHT ETC>). Right-click any point on Earth for a country dossier, head-of-state lookup, and the latest Sentinel-2 satellite photo. No user data is collected or transmitted — the dashboard runs entirely in your browser against a self-hosted backend.

Designed for analysts, researchers, radio operators, and anyone who wants to see what the world looks like when every public signal is on the same map.


## Why This Exists

A surprising amount of global telemetry is already public — aircraft ADS-B broadcasts, maritime AIS signals, satellite orbital data, earthquake sensors, mesh radio networks, police scanner feeds, environmental monitoring stations, internet infrastructure telemetry, and more. This data is scattered across dozens of tools and APIs. ShadowBroker combines all of it into a single interface.

The project does not introduce new surveillance capabilities — it aggregates and visualizes existing public datasets. It is fully open-source so anyone can audit exactly what data is accessed and how. No user data is collected or transmitted — everything runs locally against a self-hosted backend. No telemetry, no analytics, no accounts.

### Shodan Connector

ShadowBroker includes an optional Shodan connector for operator-supplied API access. Shodan results are fetched with your own `SHODAN_API_KEY`, rendered as a local investigative overlay (not merged into core feeds), and remain subject to Shodan’s terms of service.

## Interesting Use Cases

* **Transmit on the InfoNet testnet** — the first decentralized intelligence mesh built into an OSINT tool. Obfuscated messaging with gate personas, Dead Drop peer-to-peer exchange, and a built-in terminal CLI. No accounts, no signup. Privacy is not guaranteed yet — this is an experimental testnet — but the protocol is live and being hardened.
* **Track Air Force One**, the private jets of billionaires and dictators, and every military tanker, ISR, and fighter broadcasting ADS-B — with automatic holding pattern detection when aircraft start circling
* **Estimate where US aircraft carriers are** using automated GDELT news scraping — no other open tool does this
* **Search internet-connected devices worldwide** via Shodan — cameras, SCADA systems, databases — plotted as a live overlay on the map
* **Right-click anywhere on Earth** for a country dossier (head of state, population, languages), Wikipedia summary, and the latest Sentinel-2 satellite photo at 10m resolution
* **Click a KiwiSDR node** and tune into live shortwave radio directly in the dashboard. Click a police scanner feed and eavesdrop in one click.
* **Watch 11,000+ CCTV cameras** across 6 countries — London, NYC, California, Spain, Singapore, and more — streaming live on the map
* **See GPS jamming zones** in real time — derived from NAC-P degradation analysis of aircraft transponder data
* **Monitor satellites overhead** color-coded by mission type — military recon, SIGINT, SAR, early warning, space stations — with SatNOGS and TinyGS ground station networks
* **Track naval traffic** including 25,000+ AIS vessels, fishing activity via Global Fishing Watch, and billionaire superyachts
* **Follow earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, active wildfires** (NASA FIRMS), severe weather alerts, and air quality readings worldwide
* **Map military bases, 35,000+ power plants**, 2,000+ data centers, and internet outage regions — cross-referenced automatically
* **Connect to Meshtastic mesh radio nodes** and APRS amateur radio networks — visible on the map and integrated into Mesh Chat
* **Switch visual modes** — DEFAULT, SATELLITE, FLIR (thermal), NVG (night vision), CRT (retro terminal) — via the STYLE button
* **Track trains** across the US (Amtrak) and Europe (DigiTraffic) in real time

## ⚡ Quick Start (Docker or Podman)

Linux/Mac

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BigBodyCobain/Shadowbroker.git
cd Shadowbroker
./compose.sh up -d
```

Windows

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BigBodyCobain/Shadowbroker.git
cd Shadowbroker
docker-compose up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` to view the dashboard! *(Requires Docker or Podman)*

`compose.sh` auto-detects `docker compose`, `docker-compose`, `podman compose`, and `podman-compose`.
If both runtimes are installed, you can force Podman with `./compose.sh --engine podman up -d`.
Do not append a trailing `.` to that command; Compose treats it as a service name.

---

##  🔄 **How to Update**

If you are coming from v0.9.5 or older, you must pull the new code and rebuild your containers to get the InfoNet testnet, Shodan integration, train tracking, 8 new intelligence layers, and all performance fixes in v0.9.6.

### 🐧 **Linux & 🍎 macOS** (Terminal / Zsh / Bash)

Since these systems are Unix-based, you can use the helper script directly.

**Pull the latest code:**
```bash
git pull origin main
```
**Run the update script:**
```bash
./compose.sh down
./compose.sh up --build -d
```

### 🪟 **Windows** (Command Prompt or PowerShell)

Windows handles scripts differently. You have two ways to update:

**Method A: The Direct Way (Recommended)**
Use the docker compose commands directly. This works in any Windows terminal (CMD, PowerShell, or Windows Terminal).

**Pull the latest code:**
```DOS
git pull origin main
```

**Rebuild the containers:**
```DOS
docker compose down
docker compose up --build -d
```

**Method B: Using the Script (Git Bash)**

If you prefer using the ./compose.sh script on Windows, you must use Git Bash (installed with Git for Windows).

Open your project folder, Right-Click, and select "Open Git Bash here".

**Run the Linux commands:**
```bash
./compose.sh down
./compose.sh up --build -d
```

---

### ⚠️ **Stuck on the old version?**

**If the dashboard still shows old data after updating:**

**Clear Docker Cache:** docker compose build --no-cache

**Prune Images:** docker image prune -f

**Check Logs:** ./compose.sh logs -f backend (or docker compose logs -f backend)

---

### **☸️ Kubernetes / Helm (Advanced)**

For high-availability deployments or home-lab clusters, ShadowBroker supports deployment via **Helm**. This chart is based on the `bjw-s-labs` template and provides a robust, modular setup for both the backend and frontend.

**1. Add the Repository:**
```bash
helm repo add bjw-s-labs https://bjw-s-labs.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update
```

**2. Install the Chart:**
```bash
# Install from the local helm/chart directory
helm install shadowbroker ./helm/chart --create-namespace --namespace shadowbroker
```

**3. Key Features:**
*   **Modular Architecture:** Individually scale the intelligence backend and the HUD frontend.
*   **Security Context:** Runs with restricted UIDs (1001) for container hardening.
*   **Ingress Ready:** Compatible with Traefik, Cert-Manager, and Gateway API for secure, external access to your intelligence node.

*Special thanks to [@chr0n1x](https://github.com/chr0n1x) for contributing the initial Kubernetes architecture.*

## Experimental Testnet — No Privacy Guarantee

ShadowBroker v0.9.6 introduces **InfoNet**, a decentralized intelligence mesh with obfuscated messaging. This is an **experimental testnet** — not a private messenger.

| Channel | Privacy Status | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Meshtastic / APRS** | **PUBLIC** | RF radio transmissions are public and interceptable by design. |
| **InfoNet Gate Chat** | **OBFUSCATED** | Messages are obfuscated with gate personas and canonical payload signing, but NOT end-to-end encrypted. Metadata is not hidden. |
| **Dead Drop DMs** | **STRONGEST CURRENT LANE** | Token-based epoch mailbox with SAS word verification. Strongest lane in this build, but not yet confidently private. |

**Do not transmit anything sensitive on any channel.** Treat all lanes as open and public for now. E2E encryption and deeper native/Tauri hardening are the next milestones. If you fork this project, keep these labels intact and do not make stronger privacy claims than the implementation supports.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🐳 Docker / Podman Setup (Recommended for Self-Hosting)

The repo includes a `docker-compose.yml` that builds both images locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BigBodyCobain/Shadowbroker.git
cd Shadowbroker
# Add your API keys in a repo-root .env file (optional — see Environment Variables below)
./compose.sh up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` to view the dashboard.

> **Deploying publicly or on a LAN?** No configuration needed for most setups.
> The frontend proxies all API calls through the Next.js server to `BACKEND_URL`,
> which defaults to `http://backend:8000` (Docker internal networking).
> Port 8000 does not need to be exposed externally.
>
> If your backend runs on a **different host or port**, set `BACKEND_URL` at runtime — no rebuild required:
>
> ```bash
> # Linux / macOS
> BACKEND_URL=http://myserver.com:9096 docker-compose up -d
>
> # Podman (via compose.sh wrapper)
> BACKEND_URL=http://192.168.1.50:9096 ./compose.sh up -d
>
> # Windows (PowerShell)
> $env:BACKEND_URL="http://myserver.com:9096"; docker-compose up -d
>
> # Or add to a .env file next to docker-compose.yml:
> # BACKEND_URL=http://myserver.com:9096
> ```

If you prefer to call the container engine directly, Podman users can run `podman compose up -d`, or force the wrapper to use Podman with `./compose.sh --engine podman up -d`.
Depending on your local Podman configuration, `podman compose` may still delegate to an external compose provider while talking to the Podman socket.

### 🐋 Standalone Deploy (Portainer, Uncloud, NAS, etc.)

No need to clone the repo. Use the pre-built images published to the GitHub Container Registry.

Create a `docker-compose.yml` with the following content and deploy it directly — paste it into Portainer's stack editor, `uncloud deploy`, or any Docker host:

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    image: ghcr.io/bigbodycobain/shadowbroker-backend:latest
    container_name: shadowbroker-backend
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - AIS_API_KEY=your_aisstream_key          # Required — get one free at aisstream.io
      - OPENSKY_CLIENT_ID=                       # Optional — higher flight data rate limits
      - OPENSKY_CLIENT_SECRET=                   # Optional — paired with Client ID above
      - LTA_ACCOUNT_KEY=                         # Optional — Singapore CCTV cameras
      - SHODAN_API_KEY=                          # Optional — Shodan device search overlay
      - SH_CLIENT_ID=                            # Optional — Sentinel Hub satellite imagery
      - SH_CLIENT_SECRET=                        # Optional — paired with Sentinel Hub ID
      - CORS_ORIGINS=                            # Optional — comma-separated allowed origins
    volumes:
      - backend_data:/app/data
    restart: unless-stopped

  frontend:
    image: ghcr.io/bigbodycobain/shadowbroker-frontend:latest
    container_name: shadowbroker-frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - BACKEND_URL=http://backend:8000   # Docker internal networking — no rebuild needed
    depends_on:
      - backend
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  backend_data:
```

> **How it works:** The frontend container proxies all `/api/*` requests through the Next.js server to `BACKEND_URL` using Docker's internal networking. The browser only ever talks to port 3000 — port 8000 does not need to be exposed externally.
>
> `BACKEND_URL` is a plain runtime environment variable (not a build-time `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`), so you can change it in Portainer, Uncloud, or any compose editor without rebuilding the image. Set it to the address where your backend is reachable from inside the Docker network (e.g. `http://backend:8000`, `http://192.168.1.50:8000`).

### 📦 Quick Start (No Code Required)

If you just want to run the dashboard without dealing with terminal commands:

1. Go to the **[Releases](../../releases)** tab on the right side of this GitHub page.
2. Download the latest `.zip` file from the release.
3. Extract the folder to your computer.
4. **Windows:** Double-click `start.bat`.
   **Mac/Linux:** Open terminal, type `chmod +x start.sh`, `dos2unix start.sh`, and run `./start.sh`.
5. It will automatically install everything and launch the dashboard!

Local launcher notes:

- `start.bat` / `start.sh` currently run the hardened web/local stack, not the final native desktop boundary.
- Security-sensitive paths are hardened up to the pre-Tauri boundary, but operator-facing responsiveness still matters and is part of the acceptance bar.
- If Wormhole identity or DM contact endpoints fail after an upgrade on Windows, see `F:\Codebase\Oracle\live-risk-dashboard\docs\mesh\pre-tauri-phase-closeout.md` for the secure-storage repair workflow.

---

### 💻 Developer Setup

If you want to modify the code or run from source:

#### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** 18+ and **npm** — [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
* **Python** 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12 with `pip` — [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (**check "Add to PATH"** during install)
  * ⚠️ Python 3.13+ may have compatibility issues with some dependencies. **3.11 or 3.12 is recommended.**
* API keys for: `aisstream.io` (required), and optionally `opensky-network.org` (OAuth2), `lta.gov.sg`

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/shadowbroker.git
cd shadowbroker/live-risk-dashboard

# Backend setup
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt   # includes pystac-client for Sentinel-2

# Optional helper scripts (creates venv + installs dev deps)
# Windows PowerShell
# .\scripts\setup-venv.ps1
# macOS/Linux
# ./scripts/setup-venv.sh

# Optional env check (prints warnings for missing keys)
# Windows PowerShell
# .\scripts\check-env.ps1
# macOS/Linux
# ./scripts/check-env.sh

# Create .env with your API keys
echo "AIS_API_KEY=your_aisstream_key" >> .env
echo "OPENSKY_CLIENT_ID=your_opensky_client_id" >> .env
echo "OPENSKY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_opensky_secret" >> .env

# Frontend setup
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### Running

```bash
# From the frontend directory — starts both frontend & backend concurrently
npm run dev
```

This starts:

* **Next.js** frontend on `http://localhost:3000`
* **FastAPI** backend on `http://localhost:8000`

### Pre-commit (Optional)

If you use pre-commit, install hooks once from repo root:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

### Local AIS Receiver (Optional)

You can feed your own AIS ship data into ShadowBroker using an RTL-SDR dongle and [AIS-catcher](https://github.com/jvde-github/AIS-catcher), an open-source AIS decoder. This gives you real-time coverage of vessels in your local area — no API key needed.

1. Plug in an RTL-SDR dongle
2. Install AIS-catcher ([releases](https://github.com/jvde-github/AIS-catcher/releases)) or use the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --device /dev/bus/usb \
     ghcr.io/jvde-github/ais-catcher -H http://host.docker.internal:4000/api/ais/feed interval 10
   ```
3. Or run natively:
   ```bash
   AIS-catcher -H http://localhost:4000/api/ais/feed interval 10
   ```

AIS-catcher decodes VHF radio signals on 161.975 MHz and 162.025 MHz and POSTs decoded vessel data to ShadowBroker every 10 seconds. Ships detected by your SDR antenna appear alongside the global AIS stream.

**Docker (ARM/Raspberry Pi):** See [docker-shipfeeder](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-shipfeeder) for a production-ready Docker image optimized for ARM.

**Note:** AIS range depends on your antenna — typically 20-40 nautical miles with a basic setup, 60+ nm with a marine VHF antenna at elevation.

## 🔧 Performance

The platform is optimized for handling massive real-time datasets:

* **Gzip Compression** — API payloads compressed ~92% (11.6 MB → 915 KB)
* **ETag Caching** — `304 Not Modified` responses skip redundant JSON parsing
* **Viewport Culling** — Only features within the visible map bounds (+20% buffer) are rendered
* **Imperative Map Updates** — High-volume layers (flights, satellites, fires) bypass React reconciliation via direct `setData()` calls
* **Clustered Rendering** — Ships, CCTV, earthquakes, and data centers use MapLibre clustering to reduce feature count
* **Debounced Viewport Updates** — 300ms debounce prevents GeoJSON rebuild thrash during pan/zoom; 2s debounce on dense layers (satellites, fires)
* **Position Interpolation** — Smooth 10s tick animation between data refreshes
* **React.memo** — Heavy components wrapped to prevent unnecessary re-renders
* **Coordinate Precision** — Lat/lng rounded to 5 decimals (~1m) to reduce JSON size

## 🔑 Environment Variables

### Backend (`backend/.env`)

```env
# Required
AIS_API_KEY=your_aisstream_key                # Maritime vessel tracking (aisstream.io)

# Optional (enhances data quality)
OPENSKY_CLIENT_ID=your_opensky_client_id      # OAuth2 — higher rate limits for flight data
OPENSKY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_opensky_secret     # OAuth2 — paired with Client ID above
LTA_ACCOUNT_KEY=your_lta_key                  # Singapore CCTV cameras
SHODAN_API_KEY=your_shodan_key                # Shodan device search overlay
SH_CLIENT_ID=your_sentinel_hub_id             # Copernicus CDSE Sentinel Hub imagery
SH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_sentinel_hub_secret     # Paired with Sentinel Hub Client ID
```

### Frontend

| Variable | Where to set | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `BACKEND_URL` | `environment` in `docker-compose.yml`, or shell env | URL the Next.js server uses to proxy API calls to the backend. Defaults to `http://backend:8000`. **Runtime variable — no rebuild needed.** |

**How it works:** The frontend proxies all `/api/*` requests through the Next.js server to `BACKEND_URL` using Docker's internal networking. Browsers only talk to port 3000; port 8000 never needs to be exposed externally. For local dev without Docker, `BACKEND_URL` defaults to `http://localhost:8000`.
